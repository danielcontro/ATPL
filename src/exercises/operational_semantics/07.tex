\subsection{}

Examine how the semantics of the language would change by replacing the
(SUM RIGHT) and (SUM LEFT) rules with the following one:
\[
	\infer[\text{\small{(SUM 2)}}]
	{\SUM{M_1}{M_2} \to \SUM{M_1'}{M_2'}}
	{
		M_1 \to M_1' &
		M_2 \to M_2'
	}
\]
What would be the semantics of the term $\SUM{(\SUM{5}{2})}{4}$?\\~\\
The semantics of the language would require sums to have the same number of
reduction steps in both of the subterms $M_1$ and $M_2$ in order to be
evaluated to a value otherwise, as it happens with the term
$\SUM{(\SUM{5}{2})}{4}$, a term that would be previously evaluated to a final
value ($11$) now is a stuck term.
