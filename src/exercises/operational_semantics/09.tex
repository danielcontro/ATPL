\subsection{}

Write the transition rules corresponding to the call-by-name strategy, and
evaluate the previous term according to this strategy.\\

To obtain a call-by-name strategy the rule (APP 2) must be removed and the
(BETA) rule has to be replaced with the following
\[
	\infer[\text{\small{BETA'}}]
	{
		\APP{(\FN{x}{M_1})}{M_2} \to M_1\SUBST{x}{M_2}
	}
	{}
\]
The evaluation of the term
$\APP{(\APP{(\FN{x}{3})}{(\FN{y}{y})})}{(\APP{(\FN{z}{\IF{z}{1}{0}})}{(false)})}$
with the newly defined semantics would proceed as follows
\[
	\infer[\text{\small{APP 1}}]
	{
		\APP{(\APP{(\FN{x}{3})}{(\FN{y}{y})})}{(\APP{(\FN{z}{\IF{z}{1}{0}})}{(false)})} \to
		\APP{3}{(\APP{(\FN{z}{\IF{z}{1}{0}})}{(false)})}
	}
	{
		\infer[\text{\small{BETA'}}]
		{
			\APP{(\FN{x}{3})}{(\FN{y}{y})} \to 3
		}
		{}
	}
\]
\[
	\APP{3}{(\APP{(\FN{z}{\IF{z}{1}{0}})}{(false)})} \not\to
\]
