Does it make sense to add the subtyping rule for arrow types $A \to B$ in FJ?\\~\\
Since in FJ values are only objects and there aren't arrow types it wouldn't make sense to add
subtyping rules for them. Arrow types could be interpreted as the types of the class methods,
but it's performed overriding rather than subtyping on them.
