Prove the theorems of type preservation, progress and safety for the language with exceptions.

\subsubsection*{Progress Theorem}

If $\emptyset \vdash M: T$ then either $M$ is a value, or $\exists\, M'.\, M \to M'$ or
$\exists\, v.\, M = \THROW{v}$
By induction on the height of the derivation tree of $\emptyset \vdash M: T$:\\
The base cases are left unchanged, only the inductive ones has to be extended with the derivation
trees that have the newly added typing rules as first ones.
\begin{itemize}
	\item (T-RAISE): then $M = \THROW{N}$, by Inv. Lemma $\exists\, T_{exn}.\, \emptyset \vdash N: T_{exn}$ with
	      height of the derivation $\le k_0$ thus the inductive hyp. can be applied obtaining that
	      either:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item $N \to N'$: hence by (RAISE 1) $\exists\, M'.\, M \to M'$
		      \item $N$ is a value $v$: hence $M = \THROW{v}$
		      \item $\exists\, v.\, N = \THROW{v}$: hence by (RAISE 2) $\exists\, M'.\, M \to M'$
	      \end{itemize}
	\item (T-TRY): then $M = \TRY{M_1}{M_2}$, by Inv. Lemma
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item $\emptyset \vdash M_1: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$
		      \item $\exists\, T_{exn}.\, \emptyset \vdash M_2: T_{exn} \to T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$
	      \end{itemize}
	      hence the inductive hyp. can be applied to $M_1$
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item $M_1 \to M_1'$: hence by (TRY) $\exists\, M'.\, M \to M'$
		      \item $M_1$ is a value $v$: hence by (TRY VAL) $\exists\, M'.\, M \to M'$
		      \item $\exists\, v.\, M_1 = \THROW{v}$: hence by (TRY HANDLE) $\exists\, M'.\, M \to M'$
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Substitution Lemma:}

If $\Gamma, x: S \vdash M: T$ and $\Gamma \vdash N: S$ then $\Gamma \vdash M\SUBST{x}{N}: T$\\
By induction on the height of the derivation of $\Gamma, x: S \vdash M: T$:\\
The base cases are left unchanged, only the inductive ones has to be extended with the newly
added typing rules.
\begin{itemize}
	\item (T-RAISE): then $M = \THROW{M_1}$, by Inv. Lemma $\exists\, T_{exn}.\, \Gamma, x: S \vdash M_1: T_{exn}$ with
	      height of the derivation $\le k_0$, hence the inductive hyp. can be applied obtaining
	      $\Gamma \vdash M_1\SUBST{x}{N}: T_{exn}$, and by applying the (T-RAISE) rule it can be
	      derived $\Gamma \vdash \THROW{M_1\SUBST{x}{N}} = M\SUBST{x}{N}: T$
	\item (T-TRY): then $M = \TRY{M_1}{M_2}$ and by Inv. Lemma
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item $\Gamma, x: S \vdash M_1: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$
		      \item $\exists\, T_{exn}.\, \Gamma, x: S \vdash M_2: T_{exn} \to T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$
	      \end{itemize}
	      hence the inductive hyp. can be applied to $M_1$ and $M_2$ obtaining
	      $\Gamma \vdash M_1\SUBST{x}{N}: T$ and $\Gamma \vdash M_2\SUBST{x}{N}: T_{exn} \to T$,
	      thus by the (T-TRY) rule
	      $\Gamma \vdash \TRY{M_1\SUBST{x}{N}}{M_2\SUBST{x}{N}} = M\SUBST{x}{N}: T$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Type Preservation:}

If $\Gamma \vdash M: T$ and $M \to M'$ then $\Gamma \vdash M': T$.\\
By induction on the height of the derivation of $\Gamma \vdash M: T$:\\
The base cases are left unchanged, only the inductive ones has to be extended with the newly
added typing rules.
\begin{itemize}
	\item (T-RAISE): then $M = \THROW{N}$ and by Inv. Lemma $\exists\, T_{exn}.\, \Gamma \vdash N: T_{exn}$.
	      If $M \to M'$ one of the following rules has been applied:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item (RAISE 1): then $N \to N'$ and the inductive hyp can be applied obtaining
		            $\Gamma \vdash N': T_{exn}$, hence by the (T-RAISE) rule it can be concluded
		            $\Gamma \vdash \THROW{N'} = M': T$
		      \item (RAISE 2): hence $\Gamma \vdash \THROW{v} = M': T_{exn}$, let $T_{exn} = T$
	      \end{itemize}
	\item (T-TRY): then $M = \TRY{M_1}{M_2}$ and by Inv. Lemma
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item $\Gamma \vdash M_1: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$
		      \item $\exists\, T_{exn}.\, \Gamma \vdash M_2: T_{exn} \to T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$
	      \end{itemize}
	      If $M \to M'$ one of the following rules has been applied:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item (TRY): then $M_1 \to M_1'$, the inductive hyp. can be applied obtaining
		            $\Gamma \vdash M_1': T$ hence the (T-TRY) rule can be applied
		      \item (TRY HANDLE): $M' = \APP{M_2}{M_1}$, and by (T-APP) $\Gamma \vdash M': T$
		      \item (TRY VAL): $\Gamma \vdash M_1 = M': T$ by Inv. Lemma
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Safety Theorem:}

By Corollary of the Subject Reduction Theorem $\emptyset \vdash M': T$, by the Progress Theorem
either $M'$ value or $\exists\, M".\, M' \to M"$ but since by hypothesis $M' \not\to$ then
$M'$ value.\qed
