Is the judgement $\Gamma \vdash \APP{x}{x}: T$ derivable? If yes show a
derivation, otherwise prove that it's not derivable.\\~\\
Assume that the judgement $\Gamma \vdash \APP{x}{x}: T$ is derivable,
then there exists a derivation tree of the judgement
\begin{align*}
	\infer[\text{\small{T-APP}}]
	{\Gamma \vdash \APP{x}{x}: T}
	{
	\infer[\text{\small{T-VAR}}]{\Gamma \vdash x: T_1 \to T}{} &
		\infer[\text{\small{T-VAR}}]{\Gamma \vdash x: T_1}{}
	}
\end{align*}
As shown by the tree the judgement is derivable if
$x: T_1, x: T_1 \to T \in \Gamma$ for some $T_1, T$, but since $\Gamma$
contains a list of distinct variables it can't be the case, thus the
initial judgement isn't derivable.
