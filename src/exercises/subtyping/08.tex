Prove the theorem of type preservation, progress and safety for the base language extended with
records and subtyping.

\paragraph*{Progress theorem:\\}

If $\emptyset \vdash M: T$ then either $M$ is a value or $\exists\, M'.\, M \to M'$.\\
By induction on the height of the derivation of $\emptyset \vdash M: T$:
The base cases are left unchanged since no new typing axiom has been added, only the inductive
ones has to be updated, based on the last rule of the derivation applied.
\begin{itemize}
	\item (TYPE RECORD): then $\emptyset \vdash \REC{l_i=M_i^{i \in 1..n}}: T$, by Inv. Lemma
	      $\exists\, S_1..S_n.\,\forall\, i \in 1..n\ \emptyset \vdash M_i: S_i$ and
	      $\TREC{l_i: S_i^{i \in 1..n}} <: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$ thus the
	      inductive hypothesis can be applied, obtaining that $\forall\, i \in 1..n M_i$ is either
	      a value or $\exists\, M_i'.\, M_i \to M_i'$. If all $M_i$ are values $v_i$ then
	      $\REC{l_i=v_i^{i \in 1..n}}$ is a value, otherwise if
	      $\exists\, k \in 1..n.\exists\, M_k'.\, M_k \to M_k'$ then the (EVAL RECORD) rule can be
	      applied, hence $\exists\, M' = \REC{l_j=M_j^{j \in 1..k-1}, l_k = M_k', l_i = M_i^{i \in k+1..n}}.\, M \to M'$
	\item (TYPE SELECT): then $\emptyset \vdash \SEL{N}{l_j}: T$, by Inv. Lemma
	      $\exists\, n.\, j \in 1..n$ and
	      $\forall\, i \in 1..n.\, \exists\, l_i, T_i.\, \emptyset \vdash N: \TREC{l_i: T_i^{i \in 1..n}}$
	      and $T = T_j$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$ hence the inductive hyp. can be
	      applied obtaining that either $N$ is a value, in which case the (SELECT) rule can be
	      applied, or $\exists\, N'.\, N \to N'$, hence the (EVAL SELECT) rule applies.
	\item (SUBSUMPTION): then $\emptyset \vdash M: T$, by "Inv. Lemma" $\emptyset \vdash M: S$ and
	      $S <: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$ hence the inductive hyp. can be applied
	      obtaining that $M$ is either a value or $\exists\, M'.\, M \to M'$\qed
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Substitution Lemma:\\}
If $\Gamma, x: S \vdash M: T$ and $\Gamma \vdash N: S$ then $\Gamma \vdash M\SUBST{x}{N}: T$.
The base cases are left unchanged, only the inductive ones has to be extended with the newly
added typing rules.
By induction on the height of the derivation of $\Gamma, x: S \vdash M: T$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item (TYPE RECORD): then $\Gamma, x: S \vdash \REC{l_i=M_i^{i \in 1..n}}: T$, by Inv. Lemma
	      $\exists\, S_1..S_n.\,\forall\, i \in 1..n\ \Gamma, x: S \vdash M_i: S_i$ and
	      $\TREC{l_i: S_i^{i \in 1..n}} <: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$ thus the
	      inductive hypothesis can be applied, obtaining that
	      $\forall\, i \in 1..n \Gamma \vdash M_i\SUBST{x}{N}: S_i$, hence the (TYPE RECORD) rule
	      can be applied getting
	      $\Gamma \vdash \REC{l_i = M_i\SUBST{x}{N}^{i \in 1..n}} = M\SUBST{x}{N} : T$
	\item (TYPE SELECT): then $\Gamma, x: S \vdash \SEL{M_1}{l_j}: T$, by Inv. Lemma
	      $\exists\, n.\, j \in 1..n$ and
	      $\forall\, i \in 1..n.\, \exists\, l_i, T_i.\, \Gamma, x: S \vdash M_1: \TREC{l_i: T_i^{i \in 1..n}}$
	      and $T = T_j$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$ hence the inductive hyp. can be
	      applied obtaining that
	      $\Gamma \vdash M_1\SUBST{x}{N}: \TREC{l_i: T_i^{i \in 1..n}}$ hence the (TYPE SELECT) rule
	      can be applied obtaining $\Gamma \vdash \SEL{M_1\SUBST{x}{N}}{l_j} = M\SUBST{x}{N}: T_j$
	\item (SUBSUMPTION): then $\Gamma, x:S \vdash M: T$, by "Inv. Lemma" $\Gamma, x: S \vdash M: U$
	      and $U <: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$ hence the inductive hyp. can be
	      applied obtaining $\Gamma \vdash M\SUBST{x}{N}: U$ hence the (SUBSUMPTION) rule can
	      be applied getting $\Gamma \vdash M\SUBST{x}{N}: T$\qed
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Type preservation:\\}
If $\Gamma \vdash M: T$ and $M \to M'$ then $\Gamma \vdash M': T$.
The base cases are left unchanged, only the inductive ones has to be extended with the newly
added typing rules.
By induction on the height of the derivation of $\Gamma \vdash M: T$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item (TYPE RECORD): then $\Gamma \vdash \REC{l_i=M_i^{i \in 1..n}}: T$, by Inv. Lemma
	      $\exists\, S_1..S_n.\,\forall\, i \in 1..n\ \Gamma \vdash M_i: S_i$ and
	      $\TREC{l_i: S_i^{i \in 1..n}} <: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$, moreover if
	      $M \to M'$ then $M'$ is the result of the (EVAL RECORD) rule, hence
	      $\exists\, j \in 1..n.\, M_j \to M_j'$ thus the inductive hypothesis can be applied,
	      obtaining that $\Gamma \vdash M_j': S_j$ and now (TYPE RECORD) can be applied in order to
	      get $\Gamma \vdash \REC{l_i=M_i^{i \in 1..j-i}, l_j=M_j', l_k = M_k^{k \in j+1..n}}: \TREC{l_i: S_i^{i \in 1..n}}$
	      and by (SUBSUMPTION) $\Gamma \vdash \REC{l_i=M_i^{i \in 1..j-i}, l_j=M_j', l_k = M_k^{k \in j+1..n}} = M': T$
	\item (TYPE SELECT): then $\Gamma \vdash \SEL{N}{l_j}: T$, by Inv. Lemma
	      $\exists\, n.\, j \in 1..n$ and
	      $\forall\, i \in 1..n.\, \exists\, l_i, T_i.\, \Gamma \vdash N: \TREC{l_i: T_i^{i \in 1..n}}$
	      and $T = T_j$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$, moreover if $M \to M'$ it was applied either the rule:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item (SELECT): hence $M' = v_j$ and by Inv. Lemma on $\Gamma \vdash N: \TREC{l_i: T_i^{i \in 1..n}}$
		            $\exists\, S_1..S_n.\,\forall\, i \in 1..n\ \Gamma \vdash v_i: S_i$ and
		            $\TREC{l_i: S_i^{i \in 1..n}} <: \TREC{l_i: T_i^{i \in 1..n}}$, by (SUB DEPTH)
		            $\forall\, i \in 1..n\ S_i <: T_i$ hence by (SUBSUMPTION) $\Gamma \vdash v_j: T_j$
		      \item (EVAL SELECT): hence $N \to N'$ and the inductive hypothesis can be applied
		            obtaining $\Gamma \vdash N': \TREC{l_i: T_i^{i \in 1..n}}$ from  which the
		            (TYPE SELECT) rule can be applied in order to get $\Gamma \vdash \SEL{N'}{l_j} = M': T_j$
	      \end{itemize}
	\item (SUBSUMPTION): then $\Gamma \vdash M: T$, by "Inv. Lemma" $\Gamma \vdash M: S$
	      and $S <: T$ with height of the derivation $\le k_0$ hence the inductive hyp. can be
	      applied obtaining $\Gamma \vdash M': S$ hence the (SUBSUMPTION) rule can
	      be applied getting $\Gamma \vdash M': T$\qed
\end{itemize}
