Is the term $M = \IF{true}{1}{false}$ well-typed in the language with subtyping?\\~\\
Assume that $M$ is well-typed, which implies $\Gamma \vdash \IF{true}{1}{false}: T$ then by Inv.
Lemma
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Gamma \vdash true: Bool$
	\item $\Gamma \vdash 1: T$
	\item $\Gamma \vdash false: T$
\end{itemize}

By Inv. Lemma once again $T = Bool$ and $T = Nat$ which is a contradiction, thus it must be the
case that $M$ isn't well-typed.
