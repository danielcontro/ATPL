\subsection{}
Update the proofs of Progress Theorem, Type Preservation Theorem and
Substitution Lemma in order to consider the language $\mathcal{L}$
extended with the term \unit.

\paragraph*{Substitution Lemma:\\}
Only the base cases need to be updated since the (T-UNIT) typing rule
has been added; in which case the judgement is $\Gamma, x: S \vdash
\unit: Unit$, thus $M\SUBST{x}{N} = \unit\SUBST{x}{N} = \unit$, then
$\Gamma \vdash \unit: Unit$ can be derived by the (T-UNIT) rule.

\paragraph*{Progress Theorem:\\}
No evaluation strategies were added, therefore no modifications to the
theorem should be added.


\paragraph*{Type Preservation:}
Since no semantic rules have been added the proof is left unchanged.
