Consider the following variant and rule (TYPE MATCH):
\[
	\infer[\text{\small{(TYPE MATCH GEN 1)}}]
	{ \Gamma \vdash \MATCH{M}{\CASE{l_i}{x_i}{M_i^{i \in 1..n}}}: T }
	{
	\Gamma \vdash M: \TVAR{l_i: T_i^{i \in 1..m}} &
	m \ge n &
	\forall\, i \in 1..n.\,\Gamma, x_i: T_i \vdash M_i: T
	}
\]
Prove that the safety theorem still holds or give a counterexample.\\~\\
Let $M = \MATCH{\VAR{l_2 = true}}{\CASE{l_1}{x_1}{0}}$
\[
	\infer[\text{\small{(TYPE MATCH GEN 1)}}]
	{\emptyset \vdash \MATCH{\VAR{l_2 = true}}{\CASE{l_1}{x_1}{0}}: Nat}
	{
		\infer
		{ \emptyset \vdash \VAR{l_2 = true}: \TVAR{l_1: Nat, l_2: Bool} }
		{ \infer{ \emptyset \vdash true: Bool }{\text{\small{(T-TRUE)}}} } &
		2 \ge 1 &
		\infer{ x_1: Nat \vdash 0: Nat }
		{\text{\small{(T-INT)}}}
	}
\]
Hence $M$ is a closed and well-typed term but it isn't a value nor a reducible term since the side
condition of the (MATCH) rule isn't satisfied, thus a counterexample to the Progress Theorem has
been shown, which implies that the Safety Theorem no longer holds.
