\subsection{}

Formalise a statement expressing the relationship between the
alternative operational semantics developed in the previous exercise
and the standard semantics described above.

\[M \to^* M' \Rightarrow M \leadsto^* M' \]

The opposite is not true, a counterexample could be
\(\FST{\PAIR{1}{\APP{(\FN{x}{x+3})}{(true)}}}\). According to the
default strategy it is stuck (\(\not\to\)), but thanks to our
(PROJ-1') and (PROJ-2'):

\[\FST{\PAIR{1}{\APP{(\FN{x}{x+3})}{(true)}}} \leadsto 1\] which of
course is not the same
